# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A bridge service that connects Feishu (Lark) Bot to the Claude Code Agent SDK. Users chat with Claude Code from Feishu (including mobile), with real-time streaming updates via interactive cards. Runs Claude in `bypassPermissions` mode since there's no terminal for interactive approval.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Development with tsx (hot reload)
npm run build        # TypeScript compile to dist/
npm start            # Run compiled output (dist/index.js)
```

No test framework is configured. No linter is configured.

## Architecture

The app is a TypeScript ESM project (`"type": "module"`, all imports use `.js` extensions). It connects to Feishu via WebSocket (long connection, no public IP needed) and calls Claude via the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.

### Message Flow

```
Feishu WSClient → EventHandler (auth, parse, @mention filter) → MessageBridge → ClaudeExecutor → StreamProcessor → Feishu card updates
```

### Key Modules

- **`src/index.ts`** — Entrypoint. Creates Feishu WS client, fetches bot info for @mention detection, wires up the event dispatcher and bridge, handles graceful shutdown.
- **`src/config.ts`** — Loads all config from env vars (`.env` via dotenv). `Config` interface is the central type.
- **`src/feishu/event-handler.ts`** — Registers `im.message.receive_v1` on the Lark `EventDispatcher`. Handles auth checks, text/image parsing, @mention stripping, group chat filtering (only responds when @mentioned). Exports `IncomingMessage` type.
- **`src/bridge/message-bridge.ts`** — Core orchestrator. Routes commands (`/cd`, `/reset`, `/stop`, `/status`, `/send-file`, `/help`), manages running tasks per chat (one task at a time per `chatId`), executes Claude queries with streaming card updates, handles image input/output, enforces 30-minute timeout.
- **`src/claude/executor.ts`** — Wraps `query()` from the Agent SDK as an async generator yielding `SDKMessage`. Configures permissionMode, allowedTools, MCP settings, session resume.
- **`src/claude/stream-processor.ts`** — Transforms the raw SDK message stream into `CardState` objects for display. Tracks tool calls, response text, session ID, cost/duration. Also extracts image file paths from tool outputs.
- **`src/claude/session-manager.ts`** — In-memory sessions keyed by `chatId`. Each session has a working directory and Claude session ID. Sessions expire after 24 hours. Changing working directory resets the session.
- **`src/feishu/card-builder.ts`** — Builds Feishu interactive card JSON. Cards have color-coded headers (blue=thinking/running, green=complete, red=error), tool call lists, markdown response content, and stats (cost/duration). Content truncated at 50KB.
- **`src/feishu/message-sender.ts`** — Feishu API wrapper for sending/updating cards, uploading/downloading images, sending text, and sending files (txt, pdf, etc.).
- **`src/bridge/rate-limiter.ts`** — Throttles card updates to avoid Feishu API rate limits (default 1.5s interval). Keeps only the latest pending update.

### Session Isolation

Sessions are keyed by `chatId` (not `userId`), so each group chat and DM gets its own independent session, working directory, and conversation history.

## Important Constraints

### Security Model

The service runs Claude in **`bypassPermissions` mode** — Claude can read, write, and execute commands without interactive approval. This is necessary because there's no terminal for user confirmation in a chat bot context. Users control access via `AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS` and `CLAUDE_ALLOWED_TOOLS` env vars.

### Group Chat Behavior

In group chats, the bot only responds when explicitly @mentioned. In direct messages, all messages are processed.

### Task Execution

- One task at a time per `chatId` (concurrent tasks across different chats are allowed)
- 30-minute timeout per task
- Tasks can be aborted with `/stop` command
- **Max Turns Handling**: When Claude reaches the max turn limit (default 150), the bot pauses and asks the user if they want to continue. User replies with "yes"/"y" or "no"/"n". If yes, execution continues with the same session.

### Image Support

- **Input:** Users can send images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP, BMP, SVG, TIFF) for Claude to analyze
- **Output:** Images generated by Claude (via Write, Bash, or MCP tools) are automatically uploaded to Feishu
- Max size: 10MB per image (Feishu limit)

### File Support

- **Output:** Files generated by Claude can be sent back to Feishu using `sendFileFromPath(chatId, filePath)`
- Supported formats: All file types (txt, pdf, doc, xls, mp4, opus, etc.)
- Max size: 30MB per file (Feishu limit)
- Required permission: `im:resource` (Read and upload images or other files)

### Card Updates

- Content truncated at 50KB to fit Feishu card limits
- Updates throttled to 1.5s intervals to avoid rate limits
- Color-coded status: blue (thinking/running), green (complete), red (error)

### MCP Servers

MCP servers are loaded from Claude Code's standard config files:
- Global: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Per-project: `<working-directory>/.claude/settings.json`

The bot loads MCP servers based on the working directory set via `/cd`.

## Configuration

All config is via environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Required: `FEISHU_APP_ID`, `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`. The Feishu app must have bot capability, WebSocket event mode, and `im.message.receive_v1` event subscription.

## Sending Files to Users

When users request files (e.g., "send me the file", "can I download that?"), you can send files back to Feishu:

1. **Check file exists and size**: Files must exist and be under 30MB
2. **Use sendFileFromPath**: `await this.sender.sendFileFromPath(chatId, filePath)`
3. **Send confirmation**: Optionally send a text message confirming the file was sent

The `/send-file` command supports both files and folders:
- **Files**: Sent directly if under 30MB
- **Folders**: Automatically compressed to `.tar.gz` format. If compressed size exceeds 30MB, an error is raised.

Common scenarios:
- User asks for a generated report/document
- User wants to download a created file
- User requests a project folder or directory
- User requests a log file or configuration file

The file will be uploaded to Feishu and sent as a downloadable attachment in the chat.
